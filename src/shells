# The /etc/shells file contains a list of login shells on the system.
# Applications use this file to determine whether a shell is valid. For each
# shell a single line should be present, consisting of the shell's path,
# relative to the root of the directory structure (/).
#
# For example, this file is consulted by chsh to determine whether an
# unprivileged user may change the login shell for his own account. If the
# command name is not listed, the user will be denied of change.
#
# It is a requirement for applications such as GDM which does not populate the
# face browser if it can't find /etc/shells, or FTP daemons which traditionally
# disallow access to users with shells not included in this file.
